		<h1>Renae Fisher</h1>
		<p> 
			Hi there! I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in Information Technology. 
			During my time in college, I was able to gain valuable experience through internships and other projects. 
			I'm now looking to use my knowledge and skills to make an impact in the tech industry. 
			I also enjoy working on small projects for fun in my spare time. 
			I'm excited to see what opportunities lie ahead.

			<h2>Fort Smash Twitch Stream Overlay</h2>
			<p>
				This project is an overlay for the Fort Smash Twitch stream. It was built using an Express JavaScript web server and a MariaDB database to store website data. 
				To get tournament updates from their tournament management website, the Start.gg GraphQL API was used. Lastly, Vue.js was used for the overlay.
